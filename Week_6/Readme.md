COURSE OVERVIEW

This repository serves as an instructive Java web application that showcases the effective integration of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) with SQL and Servlets. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate how CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) can be performed on a MySQL database using Servlets as the server-side components.

TOOLS
+ SQL
+ JDBC
+ SERVELET

The application provides developers with a practical understanding of building web applications with database functionality using Java technologies. By following the setup instructions, developers can easily configure the MySQL database and run the application using Maven.

The project structure emphasizes clear separation of concerns, with distinct Servlets handling specific endpoints for different database operations. The `DatabaseUtil` class enables JDBC connections to the MySQL database, while the `UserDao` class encapsulates data access operations.

The application features a basic user interface presented through an `index.html` file in the `resources` directory. Users can interact with the application by creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records.

The repository encourages community contributions, inviting developers to address issues, suggest enhancements, or introduce new features. The project adopts the permissive MIT License, allowing users to freely use, modify, and distribute the code according to their specific requirements.

By exploring this repository, developers can gain valuable insights into creating dynamic and interactive web applications using Java Servlets, JDBC, and SQL, while effectively managing data in a MySQL database. Whether for educational purposes or as a foundation for more complex projects, this repository offers a valuable resource for anyone interested in Java-based web development with database integration.
