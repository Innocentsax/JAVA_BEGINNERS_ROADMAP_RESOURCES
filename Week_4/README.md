Lambda Expressions:
Lambda expressions are a powerful feature introduced in Java 8. They provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions or "functional interfaces," allowing you to treat functionality as data. Lambda expressions are commonly used in functional programming and enable you to write more expressive, flexible, and efficient code.

Here are the important things to know about Lambda expressions:

1. Syntax: Lambda expressions have a compact syntax. The basic form of a lambda expression looks like this:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...) -> { body }

2. Functional Interfaces: Lambda expressions are used primarily with functional interfaces. A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They act as targets for lambda expressions. For example:

interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void doSomething(int value);
}

3. Type Inference: The Java compiler can often infer the type of parameters in a lambda expression, so you can omit the type declarations. This makes the lambda expression even more concise:

(int a, int b) -> a + b

4. Method References: In some cases, lambda expressions can be replaced with method references, which provide an even more concise way to represent certain types of lambda expressions.

5. Variable Capture: Lambda expressions can capture variables from their surrounding context. They can access local variables and instance variables, but those variables must be effectively final (i.e., their values should not change after they are captured).

6. Effectively Final: A variable that is not explicitly declared as final can still be captured in a lambda expression if it is effectively final, meaning it's not reassigned anywhere in the code block.

7. Functional Interfaces in Java Standard Library: Java 8 introduced several new functional interfaces in the java.util.function package, such as Predicate, Function, Consumer, and Supplier, which can be used with lambda expressions.

Stream API:
The Stream API is another powerful addition introduced in Java 8. It allows you to perform bulk data operations on collections (like lists, sets, and maps) in a functional style, which makes code more expressive, concise, and parallelizable.

Here are the important things to know about the Stream API:

Stream Creation: Streams are obtained from collections by invoking the stream() or parallelStream() method on the collection. The latter provides a parallel version of the stream, which can utilize multiple CPU cores for better performance on large data sets.

Intermediate and Terminal Operations: Streams support two types of operations: intermediate and terminal. Intermediate operations (e.g., filter, map, sorted) return a new stream and are chainable. Terminal operations (e.g., forEach, collect, reduce) produce a final result and terminate the stream.

Laziness: Streams are lazy, meaning intermediate operations are not executed until a terminal operation is called. This allows for optimization and avoids unnecessary computations.

Pipelines: You can create a pipeline of operations by chaining multiple intermediate operations together followed by a terminal operation. This allows you to perform complex data transformations in a single line of code.

Filtering: The filter operation allows you to select elements from a stream based on a specified condition.

Mapping: The map operation transforms each element in the stream to another element using the provided function.

Sorting: The sorted operation sorts the elements of the stream based on a given comparator or natural order.

Reducing: The reduce operation combines the elements of the stream into a single result by applying a binary operator. It can be used for tasks like summing, finding the maximum/minimum, etc.

Collecting: The collect operation is used to accumulate elements from a stream into a collection or perform other customized mutable reductions.

Parallel Processing: As mentioned earlier, the Stream API can leverage multi-core processors to perform operations in parallel. However, not all operations are suitable for parallelization, and you should consider factors like data size and operation complexity before using parallel streams.

Avoid Side Effects: It is essential to avoid using shared variables and side-effecting operations within lambda expressions and stream operations, as it may lead to unexpected behavior in parallel streams.

Both Lambda expressions and the Stream API are fundamental to modern Java programming and provide significant benefits in terms of code readability, maintainability, and performance. They encourage a more functional programming style in Java, making it more competitive with languages designed explicitly for functional programming.
